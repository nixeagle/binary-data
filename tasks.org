    - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2010-05-08 Sat 02:28]
    :END:
    Describe 2 major non asdf-installable dependencies, Eos and nutils.

*** TODO Handle nested binary structures
    nested binary structures are used in things like ELF, various binary
    protocols and so on.

*** TODO Handle big-endian structures
    Right now we do little-endian things ok, but things like MIPS64 are
    big endian and we have to deal with this.
